You work for a manufacturing company that produces multiple products. Each product has a cost price per unit (in dollars), sell price per unit (in dollars), and an initial inventory. The company offers a diverse range of products, and you are tasked with calculating the total profit made across all products. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar.

product_name: Name of the product.
cost_price: Cost price per unit (in dollars).
sell_price: Sell price per unit (in dollars).
inventory: Initial inventory.


products_data = [

    {"product_name": "Product B", "cost_price": 3.0, "sell_price": 6.0, "inventory": 150},
    {"product_name": "Product C", "cost_price": 2.5, "sell_price": 4.0, "inventory": 200},

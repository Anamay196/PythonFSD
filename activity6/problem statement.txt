Write a Python program that scrapes the names and prices of the best-selling books from the Books to Scrape website and saves them in a CSV file.

The program should:

1 Import the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries
2 Define the URL of the Books to Scrape website as a variable
3 Send a GET request to the URL and store the response object
4 Check if the status code of the response is 200 (OK)
5 Parse the HTML content of the response using BeautifulSoup and specify the parser as ‘html.parser’
6 Find all the book elements using the class name ‘product_pod’
7 Loop through each book element and extract the name and price using the appropriate tag names and attributes
8 Store the extracted data in a list of dictionaries
9 Import the csv library and open a new CSV file in write mode
10 Create a csv writer object and write the header row with the column names
11 Write the data rows using the writerow method
12 Close the CSV file

The website you want to get the books from is http://books.toscrape.com/

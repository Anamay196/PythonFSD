Create a web application using Flask with the following features:

Login Page: A page where users can enter their username and password.
Login Check: If the username and password are both ‘admin’, show a success message, take the user to a dashboard page, and flash a message saying “Login successful”. 
Dashboard Page: A page that shows the username of the logged-in user. If no user is logged in, go back to the login page.
Logout: A way for users to log out, which shows a message, flashes a message saying “You have been logged out”, and takes them back to the login page.
The application should remember who is logged in (session management) and should be run in debug mode.

Problem Statement2: Student Grades Analysis

You are tasked with creating a Python program for analyzing student grades. The program should read a text file containing student names and their corresponding grades, perform some analysis, and then generate a report.

Program Requirements:

-Read the contents of "grades.txt" and store the data in a suitable data structure.
-Calculate the average grade for all students.
-Identify and display the student with the highest and lowest grades.
-Generate a new text file named "report.txt" with the following format:

	Average Grade: XX.XX
	Highest Grade: StudentName (XX)
	Lowest Grade: StudentName (XX)

-Also, Implement proper error handling for the following scenarios:
	*The "grades.txt" file does not exist.
	*The file format is incorrect (e.g., missing grades or non-numeric grades).
	*Any other potential issues that might occur during file handling or data analysis.

For the given "grades.txt" file, the "report.txt" file should be generated with the calculated average, highest, and lowest grades.
